### Games:
- Bejeweled
- 1010!

### How to Play: Bejeweled

In Bejeweled, you must swap gems to make a match of three or more gems in a vertical or horizontal row. Clear gems to gain points. Try and get the highest possible points you can in the given time.

### How to Play: 1010!
In 1010, you must fill a blank grid with different-shaped blocks, presented three at a time. The colors are irrelevant, but blocks must fit together so you complete a row or a column. Every time you complete a line, the line disappears and you get more space to work in. The more space you create, the more points you get. Try and get the highest possible points you can in the given time.
